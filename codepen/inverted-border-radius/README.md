# Card Component Project

This project is a simple card component built with **HTML** and **CSS**, inspired by [this CodePen project](https://codepen.io/uxmankabir/pen/wvRgZvv). The main goal is to create a visually appealing card layout with a user image and information overlay, using modern CSS techniques like **CSS variables**, **absolute positioning**, and **clip-path** for decorative effects.
